#!/bin/bash

# This script demonstrates how to trap signals and handle them using functions



# Task: Add traps for the INT and QUIT signals. If the script receives an INT signal,

#       reset the count to the maximum and tell the user they are not allowed to interrupt

#       the count. If the script receives a QUIT signal, tell the user they found the secret

#       to getting out of the script and exit immediately.



# Task: Explain in a comment how the line with the word moose in it works.

# task answer: the line in question is an echo command as a process line of the error-message function.

# programName is a variable assigned earlier that uses basename with $0 to fetch the file's name to utilise in the script

#${1: tells the machine it's looking at the first arguement in the list with the error message attached to it

#lastly the >&2 says to send all of that output from ${1:message_here} to the same destination as stderr

# this means that that portion will not print out onto the terminal



#### Variables

programName="$(basename $0)" # used by error_functions.sh

sleepTime=1 # delay used by sleeptime

numberOfSleeps=10 # how many sleeps to wait for before quitting for inactivity



#### Functions



# This function will send an error message to stderr

# Usage:

#   error-message ["some text to print to stderr"]

#

function error-message {

        echo "${programName}: ${1:-Unknown Error - a moose bit my sister once...}" >&2

}



# This function will send a message to stderr and exit with a failure status

# Usage:

#   error-exit ["some text to print" [exit-status]]

#

function error-exit {

        error-message "$1"

        exit "${2:-1}"

}

function usage {

        cat <<EOF

Usage: ${programName} [-h|--help ] [-w|--waittime waittime] [-n|--waitcount waitcount]

Default waittime is 1, waitcount is 10

EOF
