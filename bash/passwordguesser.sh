# This script demonstrates testing to see if 2 strings are the same

# TASK 1: Improve it by asking the user for a password guess instead of using inline literal data
# TASK 2: Improve it by rewriting it to use the if command
# TASK 3: Improve it by giving them 3 tries to get it right before failing (test 3 times but only if necessary)
#           *** Do not use the exit command
